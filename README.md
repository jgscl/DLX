# DLX - An assembler algorithm optimization 
A Bacherlor's project for the Computer Architecture subject. It consists on building an algorithm that performs a task and then reducing the total cycles executed to the minimum possible.

The code and documents are all in Spanish.

## Task to perform
[This document](docs/Enunciado_DLX.pdf)

## Conclusions
There has been a 518.67% of improvement in terms of cycle reduction. The non-optimized algorithm has 2417 cycles and the optimized one has 466. Writing code in assembler allows to make code execution way faster than normal compiled code. On the other hand, the improvements in speed make the code less readable and harder to maintain which can be specially awful for big projects.
